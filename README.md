# Word-Guess-Game

This project is an introductory lesson in javascript. The goal of this project is to create a game where the user is given 10 chances
to guess which letter the computer has pre selected. If the user guesses correctly, his or her score will increase by one point. If the 
user guesses incorrectly, his or her score will decrease by one point.

The game is predicated on the propper syntax and order of conditional, as well as "if" or "else" statements which instructs the computer on
what to display if the user provides a specific type of information.

The game must include an array (from which the computer may first select a letter from) and the correct type and amount of variables that
the user's input of information efficient and easy to follow.
